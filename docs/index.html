<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p style="line-height:200%">
    In this project, we implement all the required parts for the cloth simulation. First, we utilize masses and springs to represent our cloth. Then we update the movement
    of our created masses and springs using numerical integration. Next we handled different collision situations containning collisions with planes, collisions with spheres
    and self-collisions. Later we wrote the shader program to create shader effect for our cloth.
    After finishing all the parts above, our code can create a nice simulation of cloth movement, collision and different shader effects.

    Experiment with some the parameters in the simulation.
</h3>

<h4>
    The effects of changing the spring constant <b>ks</b>.
</h4>
<p style="line-height:200%">
    The current spring constant ks is 5000N/m. In the following experiments, we change our ks to a very low value (100 N/m) and a very high value
    (100000 N/m). Here is final resting state based on different ks values for your reference:
    <div align="middle">
        <table style="width:100%">
            <tr align="center">
                <td>
                    <img src="part2/1_1.png" align="middle" width="450px" />
                    <figcaption>ks = 100 N/m</figcaption>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="part2/1_2.png" align="middle" width="450px" />
                    <figcaption>ks = 100000 N/m</figcaption>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
<p style="line-height:200%">
    The biggest differences among these images on the top of each cloth. If the ks value is too high, the cloth may appear rigid and unnatural,
    while if it's too low, the cloth may look too floppy and lack structure. (There is little falloff with high Ks value and too much falloff with low Ks value).
    This is very easy to understand based on <b>Hooke's law</b> that when ks is too high, it means that the cloth is very resistant to deformation, which makes it more rigid and less flexible.
    On the other hand, when ks is too low, it means that the cloth is not resistant enough to deformation, which makes it more floppy and less structured.
</p>
</p>
<h4>
    The effects of changing the spring constant <b>density</b>.
</h4>
<p style="line-height:200%">
    The current spring constant density is 15g/cm * cm. In the following experiments, we change our density to a very low value (1g/cm * cm) and a very high value
    (100g/cm * cm). Here is final resting state based on different density values for your reference:
    <div align="middle">
        <table style="width:100%">
            <tr align="center">
                <td>
                    <img src="part2/2_1.png" align="middle" width="450px" />

                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="part2/2_2.png" align="middle" width="450px" />
                    <figcaption>density = 100g/cm * cm</figcaption>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
</p><p style="line-height:200%">
    The biggest differences among these images on the top of each cloth too. Higher density means higher mass. With the same acceleration, 
    higher mass means bigger force. While remaining the same ks (the resistant ability is the same), bigger force will deform the cloth more than
    smaller force.
</p>
</p>
<h4>
    The effects of changing the spring constant <b>damping</b>.
</h4>

<p style="line-height:200%">
    The current spring constant damping is 20%. In the following experiments, we change our damping value to a very low value (0%) and a very high value
    (100%). Here is final resting state based on different damping values for your reference:
    <div align="middle">
        <table style="width:100%">
            <tr align="center">
                <td>
                    <img src="part2/3_1.png" align="middle" width="450px" />
                    <figcaption>damping = 0%</figcaption>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="part2/3_2.png" align="middle" width="450px" />
                    <figcaption>damping = 100%</figcaption>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
</p><p style="line-height:200%">
    If the damping value is too low, the cloth may continue to oscillate or vibrate even after the external force has been removed (see picture damping = 0%), which can result in unnatural-looking cloth behavior.
    On the other hand, if the damping value is too high, the cloth may lose its flexibility and become overly sluggish (see picture damping = 100%), making it difficult to achieve a natural-looking movement.
    A high damping value can lead to slow simulation times as it takes more time for the cloth to come to rest after a deformation or force has been applied.
    A high damping value can also lead to slow simulation times as the cloth may continue to oscillate or vibrate even after the external force has been removed.

<h2 align="middle" class="page-break">Part V:  Shaders</h2>
<h3 style="line-height:200%">
    Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
</h3>
<p style="line-height:200%">
    A shader program is a set of instructions that describe how to render objects in a 3D scene,
    including how they should be colored, shaded, and lit. Comparing with our previous rendering assignments that were operated utilizing CPU,
    Shaders are isolated programs that run in parallel on GPU, executing sections of the graphics pipeline, taking in an input, and outputing a single 4 dimensional vector.
    shaders are typically divided into two main types: vertex shaders and fragment shaders.
    <ul>
        <li style="line-height:200%">
            <b>vertex shaders</b>: Vertex shaders are responsible for transforming the vertices of 3D objects from their original positions in 3D space to their final positions on the 2D screen.
            They also compute other per-vertex data such as texture coordinates, normals, and tangents that are used later in the pipeline.
        </li>
        <li style="line-height:200%">
            <b>fragment shaders</b>:  Fragment shaders operate on a per-pixel basis and are responsible for computing the final color of each pixel on the screen. They take as input interpolated data from the vertex shader, such as texture coordinates and normals,
            and use that data to compute lighting and material effects.
        </li>
        <li style="line-height:200%">
            <b>How do they work together</b>:  The vertex shader computes per-vertex data such as normals, which are used by the fragment shader to compute lighting effects. The fragment shader takes the interpolated normals and other data from the vertex shader and 
            computes the final color of each pixel based on the lighting and material properties of the object.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h3 style="line-height:200%">
    Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.
</h3>
<p style="line-height:200%">
    The Blinn-Phong model calculates the color of a pixel by considering three main factors: ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting.
    <ul>
        <li style="line-height:200%">
            <b>ambient lighting</b>: Ambient lighting represents the overall lighting in the scene and is typically a constant value for all pixels.
        </li>
        <li style="line-height:200%">
            <b>diffuse lighting</b>: Diffuse lighting is caused by the interaction of light with the rough surface of an object, and it is calculated based on the angle between the light source and the surface normal of the object. The larger the angle, the less light is reflected, resulting in darker areas on the object.
        </li>
        <li style="line-height:200%">
            <b>specular lighting</b>: Specular lighting is caused by the interaction of light with a smooth or glossy surface of an object, and it is calculated based on the angle between the viewer's position and the reflection of the light source. This creates bright spots or highlights on the surface of the object.

    Show a screenshot of bump mapping on the cloth and on the sphere. 
    Show a screenshot of displacement mapping on the sphere. 
    Use the same texture for both renders. 
    You can either provide your own texture or use one of the ones in the textures directory, 
    BUT choose one that's not the default texture_2.png. 
    Compare the two approaches and resulting renders in your own words. 
    Compare how your the two shaders react to the sphere by changing the sphere mesh's coarseness by using -o 16 -a 16 and then -o 128 -a 128.

    Before doing the following experiments, let us show your our selected texture, we change our texture from texture_2.png to texture_4.png.
    The corresponding pictures are shown below:

            <b>bump mapping</b>: Bump mapping modifies the normal vectors of an object so that the fragment shader
            gives the illusion of detail (such as bumps) on an object.
        </li>
        <li style="line-height:200%">
            <b>displacement mapping</b>: Displacement mapping actually modifies the geometry of the underlying mesh to simulate surface detail.Like bump mapping, it uses a grayscale texture map to specify the displacement of each vertex of the mesh, but in this case, the displacement is actually applied to the mesh geometry. This creates a more realistic effect, as the surface detail is physically present in the mesh geometry. However, this technique is more computationally expensive than bump mapping, as it requires additional processing power to modify the mesh geometry.
        </li>
        <li style="line-height:200%">
            <b>rendering result comparison</b>: As we can see in the experiments, bump mapping and displacement mapping can produce similar effects, depending on the complexity of the surface detail being simulated.
            However, displacement mapping can produce more accurate and realistic results, as it actually modifies the geometry of the object to simulate surface detail.

    We can see with higher resolution, we can create smoother and better result. With lower resolution, circles will look like polygons.
    And the there is some discontinuity happened on the intersection points for each line.
