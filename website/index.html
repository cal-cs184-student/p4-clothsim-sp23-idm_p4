<h3>
    Experiment with some the parameters in the simulation.
</h3>

<h4>
    The effects of changing the spring constant <b>ks</b>.
</h4>
<p style="line-height:200%">
    The current spring constant ks is 5000N/m. In the following experiments, we change our ks to a very low value (100 N/m) and a very high value
    (100000 N/m). Here is final resting state based on different ks values for your reference:
    <div align="middle">
        <table style="width:100%">
            <tr align="center">
                <td>
                    <img src="part2/1_1.png" align="middle" width="450px" />
                    <figcaption>ks = 100 N/m</figcaption>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="part2/1_2.png" align="middle" width="450px" />
                    <figcaption>ks = 100000 N/m</figcaption>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
<p style="line-height:200%">
    The biggest differences among these images on the top of each cloth. If the ks value is too high, the cloth may appear rigid and unnatural,
    while if it's too low, the cloth may look too floppy and lack structure. (There is little falloff with high Ks value and too much falloff with low Ks value).
    This is very easy to understand based on <b>Hooke's law</b> that when ks is too high, it means that the cloth is very resistant to deformation, which makes it more rigid and less flexible.
    On the other hand, when ks is too low, it means that the cloth is not resistant enough to deformation, which makes it more floppy and less structured.
</p>
</p>
<h4>
    The effects of changing the spring constant <b>density</b>.
</h4>
<p style="line-height:200%">
    The current spring constant density is 15g/cm * cm. In the following experiments, we change our density to a very low value (1g/cm * cm) and a very high value
    (100g/cm * cm). Here is final resting state based on different density values for your reference:
    <div align="middle">
        <table style="width:100%">
            <tr align="center">
                <td>
                    <img src="part2/2_1.png" align="middle" width="450px" />
                    <figcaption>density = 1g/cm * cm</figcaption>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="part2/2_2.png" align="middle" width="450px" />
                    <figcaption>density = 100g/cm * cm</figcaption>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
</p><p style="line-height:200%">
    The biggest differences among these images on the top of each cloth too. Higher density means higher mass. With the same acceleration, 
    higher mass means bigger force. While remaining the same ks (the resistant ability is the same), bigger force will deform the cloth more than
    smaller force.
</p>
</p>
<h4>
    The effects of changing the spring constant <b>damping</b>.
</h4>

<p style="line-height:200%">
    The current spring constant damping is 20%. In the following experiments, we change our damping value to a very low value (0%) and a very high value
    (100%). Here is final resting state based on different damping values for your reference:
    <div align="middle">
        <table style="width:100%">
            <tr align="center">
                <td>
                    <img src="part2/3_1.png" align="middle" width="450px" />
                    <figcaption>damping = 0%</figcaption>
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="part2/3_2.png" align="middle" width="450px" />
                    <figcaption>damping = 100%</figcaption>
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
    </div>
</p><p style="line-height:200%">
    If the damping value is too low, the cloth may continue to oscillate or vibrate even after the external force has been removed (see picture damping = 0%), which can result in unnatural-looking cloth behavior.
    On the other hand, if the damping value is too high, the cloth may lose its flexibility and become overly sluggish (see picture damping = 100%), making it difficult to achieve a natural-looking movement.
    A high damping value can lead to slow simulation times as it takes more time for the cloth to come to rest after a deformation or force has been applied.
    A high damping value can also lead to slow simulation times as the cloth may continue to oscillate or vibrate even after the external force has been removed.
